        <h1>India</h1>

        <h1>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage
            and
            myriad attractions, the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers an area of
            32,
            87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the
            7th
            largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the
            sea,
            which give the country a distinct geographical entity</h1>
        
        <h1>
            Whether it is the shore temples of Mahabalipuram, the Sun Temple of Konark built in stone and poised like a chariot
            that's about to take off, to the Mughal masterpieces like Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri, Agra Fort, Humayun's Tomb, Jama
            Masjid, the Red Fort.
