            <h1 class="heading">Pune</h1>
        
            <h1 class="beauty">Pune is one of the largest IT hubs in India. It is also one of the most important automobile and manufacturing hubs of
            India. Pune is often referred to as "Oxford of the East" because of its highly regarded educational institutions. It has
            been ranked "the most liveable city in India" several times.</h1>
        
            <h1 class="famous">Pune's pleasant climate has always been a reason for people preferring the city as their residence. Pune does not get
            very hot even during the summers, and you can get respite from the heat just by standing under a tree.</h1>
